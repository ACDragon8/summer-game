Lore:
	Game will follow a chapter format - ie player is building their 'story'

	As player defeats enemies, more pages are added to their 'storybook'

	Stealing the stories of the old library of ruina

	Also every time clearing a floor we can give a little bit of lore via cutscene or smthing

	Chapter 0:
		backstory of the OC
		maybe is locked/faded/unreadable and gets unscrambled as runs go
		Gives them their basic powers
		Maybe also other upgrades so its roguelite not roguelike? idk tho it might not fit lore
	Chapter 1:
		Every time player is defeated, restart at Chapter 1
		Lower tree of life (Briah I think)
		Randomizes between Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, and Netzach floors
		
	Chapter 2:
		Randomizes between Tiphereth, Gebura, and Chesed floors
	
	Chapter 3:
		Randomizes between Binah and Hokma
			maybe we can add in keter? i kind of want to make roland a wandering boss monster though

	Chapter 4:
		Keter
		boss fight against Angela
		even if we win we still don't because its all a simulation
	
	Eventually they are supposed to piece together all of the library and confront Angela

	Maybe? Chapter 5:
		Final fight between Angela and OC
			Normal/Bad ending: If defeat angela, claim the library's power and become its new head librarian, perpetuating city cycle
			True ending: refuse to fight angela and convince her to release the light
				light gets released and player along with others are set free in the city
				player leaves with their ego equiment of their 'storybook' which makes 
				them as strong as a color fixer cuz theyve been fighting effectively color fixer level threats
			


Map Gameplay Ideas: (card getting, upgrades etc.)
	Beating an enemy gives choice of like 3 cards which are fixed
